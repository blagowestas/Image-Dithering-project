# Image Dithering Project
### for Functional Programming course at FMI. 

The main task is to implement all 11 algorithms from this artichle : https://tannerhelland.com/2012/12/28/dithering-eleven-algorithms-source-code.html

The program can read image from a file with one of the extensions: .ppm, .pgm, .pbm. 
User can choose one of eleven dithering algorithms and file format for the dithered version of the image.

We have this image in ppm format:

And after OneDemensional algorithm we have this:

*the images are png because ppm is not supported but this is the idea*


TODO:
- implement all 11 algorithms
- make some tests
